# Sabrina_Bachelor-Thesis_BiGCAT

This GitHub repository corresponds to my thesis for my bachelor in Biomedical Sciences at Maastricht University. 

My research aim was to determine the changes in the microbiome, host proteome and host metabolome between insulin resistant and insulin sensitive pre diabetics as well as to investigate the biological implications of these changes.

Data from the iHMP's study on T2D was used.


The R scripts, input data and results of the proteomic and the metabolomic differential analysis can be found in the 'Proteomic Differential Analysis' and 'Metabolomic Differential Analysis' folders, respectively.

As for the metagenomic analysis and the metagenomic-metabolomic integrative analysis, the R script, input data and some of the results can be found in the 'Metagenomic + Integrative Analysis' folder.

The extended network of the significantly altered proteins can be found in 'Network Analysis' and the PathVisio input files as well as results can be found in 'Combined Pathway Analysis'.
